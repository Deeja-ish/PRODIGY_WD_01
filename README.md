Interactive Responsive Navbar
This project is a clean, modern, and fully responsive navigation bar built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's designed to be a lightweight and reusable component for any web project.

The navbar starts as transparent and transitions to a solid background with a shadow upon scrolling. On smaller screens, the navigation links collapse into a hamburger menu that can be toggled.
